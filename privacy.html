<p style="text-align: left;"><span style="color: #000000;">We, or our advertising partners, use the information that is collected to make sure the adverts you see either on our site or other parties&rsquo; websites (where our partners have advertising space) are more relevant to you.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: left;"><span style="color: #000000;">Typically cookies and similar technologies are used to provide this type of advertising. You can find out more about cookies and how to manage their use by reading our cookie notice below.</span></p>

Data may be transferred from the EEA for the purposes of hosting our website servers on which data is held. If you book a trip in a destination outside of the EEA, your information may also be passed to the relevant airline, hotel and/or activity providers in such destination. Some of these jurisdictions offer differing levels of protection in respect of personal information and may, in certain instances, be less protective than the jurisdiction you are typically resident in. We will take all reasonable steps to ensure that your personal information is treated securely and in accordance with applicable law and this privacy notice.</span></p>
