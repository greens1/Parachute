<p style="text-align: left;"><span style="color: #000000;">The terms and conditions set out in this section are related to all bookings made through the Parachute website. </span></p>
<p style="text-align: left;"><span style="color: #000000;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p style="text-align: left;"><span style="color: #000000;"><strong>4.1. YOUR COMMITMENT TO US </strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align: left;"><span style="color: #000000;">When you make a booking, you are confirming that you understand and have accepted on behalf of yourself and all members of your party our Important Holiday Information that forms our booking conditions. All contracts with Parachute are made subject to these booking conditions and are subject to Irish law and the jurisdiction of the Irish Courts. Many airlines now require the full name of all passengers travelling. Parachute will therefore ask you at the time of booking to provide us with your first forename (as shown in your passport) as well as your title and surname.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: left;"><span style="color: #000000;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p style="text-align: left;"><span style="color: #000000;"><strong>4.2. OUR COMMITMENT TO YOU </strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align: left;"><span style="color: #000000;">Your contract is with Parachute. We will arrange to provide you with the various services, which form part of the holiday you book with us. A booking is not accepted until Parachute issue a confirmation invoice. The date shown on the invoice which will be sent to you is the date of booking. It is important to check the details on the invoice when you get it. In the event of any discrepancy please contact us immediately. </span></p>
<p style="text-align: left;"><span style="color: #000000;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p style="text-align: left;"><span style="color: #000000;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p style="text-align: left;"><span style="color: #000000;"><strong>4.3. PAYING FOR YOUR HOLIDAY </strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align: left;"><span style="color: #000000;">At the time of the booking you will be required to pay the full balance for your holiday. This holiday cost is non-refundable.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: left;"><span style="color: #000000;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p style="text-align: left;"><span style="color: #000000;"><strong>4.4. INSURANCE</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align: left;"><span style="color: #000000;">We strongly recommend that you have full travel insurance to cover your holiday. This is not included in the price of your trip and if you decide not to take this, you do so at your own risk.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: left;"><span style="color: #000000;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p style="text-align: left;"><span style="color: #000000;"><strong>4.5. IF YOU WANT TO CHANGE YOUR HOLIDAY</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align: left;"><span style="color: #000000;">Bookings made through Parachute cannot be changed by you nor can they be cancelled or refunded. Notwithstanding this, if you wish to cancel or make a change to your booking, then we may at our discretion, use reasonable endeavours to assist you to make the required change. We give no guarantee that any such attempts will be successful. The travel provider may charge a cancellation or amendment fee (as shown in their terms and conditions), which may be as much as 100% of the cost of the travel arrangements. If it is possible to make the change, it will be subject to an administration charge and payment of any further costs incurred as a result of the change. Scheduled airlines normally regard name changes as a cancellation and require rebooking and any alteration may incur a 100% cancellation charge in respect of the airfare.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: left;"><span style="color: #000000;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p style="text-align: left;"><span style="color: #000000;"><strong>4.6. IF YOU WANT TO CANCEL YOUR HOLIDAY</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align: left;"><span style="color: #000000;">If you or anyone on your holiday booking decides to cancel the holiday you must notify us of the decision as soon as possible. Any notification by telephone must also be confirmed in writing or by e-mail within 24-hours by the person who made the original booking. Cancellation will take effect from the day we are notified provided that written confirmation is received by us within 24-hours of the original notification. The cancellation charge will be 100% of the total holiday cost. As previously noted, we would strongly recommend you take out full insurance, which will in most cases include cover, under certain circumstances, against cancellation fees.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: left;"><span style="color: #000000;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p style="text-align: left;"><span style="color: #000000;"><strong>4.7. FLIGHTS</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align: left;"><span style="color: #000000;">Due to the bespoke nature of the holiday, we are not able to specify on the website the airline or aircraft type that we will use.&nbsp; We will inform you of the airline we plan to use in your quote, but we reserve the right to change airline or aircraft types at any time (see amendments by us).&nbsp; Such changes will not be regarded as a major change for the purpose of these booking conditions and you will not be entitled to cancel the holiday or holidays booked using this website without paying the appropriate cancellation charges (see cancellation charges).&nbsp; Some flights may have to stop en route and as factors affecting this are not always known before departure, we cannot always notify you in advance, although we will always endeavour to do so.&nbsp; Planned flight times will be given in the documentation you receive, although these are for guidance only.&nbsp; Please check your final itinerary as soon as you receive it, as it will show the final timings for your flight (we recommend you re-confirm flight times with the airline shortly before departure for any schedule changes). Flights are subject to the granting of permits and licenses by authorities, both in the UK and Overseas.&nbsp; In the event of your flight arrangements being changed or cancelled, as outlined in this section, we accept no liability for extra costs or consequential loss, arising directly or indirectly from any independent contract arrangement, between the client and a third party.&nbsp; Please note that the captain of the aircraft has absolute authority over the aircraft and passengers at all times, when they are boarding or on board the aircraft.&nbsp; He can refuse to carry anyone if they are, in his opinion, unfit for any reason to travel or may pose a danger to the aircraft or other passengers. If you or any person for whom you are booking is refused carriage in these circumstances, the contract with us will terminate immediately and we will have no further responsibility of liability to you. Arrangements in the event of travel delay are the responsibility of the carrier.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: left;"><span style="color: #000000;"><strong>&nbsp;</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align: left;"><span style="color: #000000;"><strong>4.8. IF WE CHANGE YOUR HOLIDAY BEFORE YOUR DEPARTURE</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align: left;"><span style="color: #000000;">It is unlikely that we will have to make any changes to your holiday, but we do plan the arrangements many months in advance. Occasionally, changes may have to be made (e.g., to itineraries, accommodation or other arrangements), which we reserve the right to do at any time. If your accommodation has to be changed, we will do our utmost to provide accommodation of a similar rating. If a significant change becomes necessary, we will inform you as soon as reasonably possible if there is time before your departure.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: left;"><span style="color: #000000;">Important Notes</span></p>
<p style="text-align: left;"><span style="color: #000000;">(a) Compensation will not apply if payment of your holiday has not been received by Parachute by the stipulated payment date or there are any pending issues such as chargebacks pending on your payment.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: left;"><span style="color: #000000;">(b) Changes due to circumstances beyond our control - Compensation will not be paid if Parachute are forced to cancel or in any way change your holiday as a result of unusual or unforeseeable situations outside our control, the consequences of which could not have been avoided even with all due care. These include unavoidable technical problems with transport, changes imposed by rescheduling or cancellation of flights by an airline or main charterer, the alteration of the airline or aircraft type, Force Majeure events including but not limited to: war or threat of war, civil strife, industrial disputes, natural disasters, bad weather, epidemic or terrorist activity.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: left;"><span style="color: #000000;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p style="text-align: left;"><span style="color: #000000;"><strong>4.9. IF WE CANCEL YOUR HOLIDAY</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align: left;"><span style="color: #000000;">We reserve the right in any circumstances to cancel your holiday for any reason. However, we will endeavour not do so unless it is due to circumstances beyond our control. If we have to cancel your holiday we will offer you: -&nbsp; </span></p>
<p style="text-align: left;"><span style="color: #000000;">(a) Alternative travel arrangements of equivalent or of very closely similar standard and price, if available or (b) A full refund of all monies paid. The exception to this is where flights from a low cost/budget airline have been included in your holiday (including but not limited to Easyjet, Ryanair, Jet 2, British Airways (Domestic/Europe), Aer Lingus, Iberia, KLM, FlyBe, Germanwings). The cost of your flight in this instance will be non-refundable.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: left;"><span style="color: #000000;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p style="text-align: left;"><span style="color: #000000;"><strong>4.10. ACCOMMODATION IN THE TROPICS</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align: left;"><span style="color: #000000;">In many hotels, especially beach resorts &lsquo;insects&rsquo; in the rooms (e.g. cockroaches etc.) are almost inevitable. It should by no means be taken as a sign of dirtiness, simply a fact of life in these destinations. Views from some hotel rooms may be partly obscured by palm trees and other vegetation that can grow very quickly in tropical climates.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: left;"><span style="color: #000000;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p style="text-align: left;"><span style="color: #000000;"><strong>4.11. WATER SPORTS &amp; OTHER ACTIVITIES</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align: left;"><span style="color: #000000;">Many hotels offer water sports and other sporting activities, in some cases these may be free of charge. Please note that in the interest of your personal safety, the operators of these activities may require that you demonstrate your competence (for example a swimming test) prior to commencement and reserve the right to refuse participation for any reason if they feel this may compromise your or another guest&rsquo;s safety.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: left;"><span style="color: #000000;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p style="text-align: left;"><span style="color: #000000;"><strong>4.12. BEHAVIOUR</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align: left;"><span style="color: #000000;">Most people go on holiday for rest and relaxation, so if in our reasonable opinion or in the opinion of any airline pilot, hotel manager, tour leader or other person in authority, your behaviour is causing danger, damage to property or persistently affecting the enjoyment of others, we reserve the right to terminate your holiday. Should this happen no refund or compensation will be paid.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: left;"><span style="color: #000000;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p style="text-align: left;"><span style="color: #000000;"><strong>4.13. ACCOMMODATION</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align: left;"><span style="color: #000000;">Please note that some hotels make small, daily, local charges for additional room facilities e.g. an in-room safe, resort facilities and on-site parking (resort fees). These charges are not pre-payable and may not be included in your holiday price but are advertised at hotel check-in and payable locally. Other destinations have a city tax levied by local authorities and can only be paid locally at your hotel.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: left;"><span style="color: #000000;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p style="text-align: left;"><span style="color: #000000;">If your holiday includes a stay in an apartment, often you will be asked to pay a refundable deposit on arrival at the property (which will be refunded on your departure). Apartments may also charge a cleaning fee. We will do our best to inform you of these fees if they are made available to us. Any failure to inform you of these charges will not result in any compensation being due to you.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: left;"><span style="color: #000000;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p style="text-align: left;"><span style="color: #000000;"><strong>4.14. LOST ITEMS</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align: left;"><span style="color: #000000;">If you lose any personal items whilst on holiday, please obtain a written report from local representative or police, to help with any insurance claim upon your return.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: left;"><span style="color: #000000;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p style="text-align: left;"><span style="color: #000000;"><strong>4.15. COMPLAINTS</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align: left;"><span style="color: #000000;">If you have cause for complaint whilst on holiday, you must bring it to the attention of the hotel immediately. They will do their best to rectify the situation. If your complaint cannot be resolved locally, you must advise us in writing on your return. Please write to us at Parachute, Graduate Memorial Building, Trinity College Dublin, College Green, Dublin 2. If you do not raise concerns immediately, this may affect our ability to investigate and take remedial action and it may impact on the way your complaint is dealt with.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: left;"><span style="color: #000000;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p style="text-align: left;"><span style="color: #000000;"><strong>4.16. CURTAILMENT</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align: left;"><span style="color: #000000;">If you cut short your holiday and return home early in circumstances where you have no reasonable cause for complaint about the standard of accommodation and services provided, we will not offer you any refund for the remainder of your holiday not completed, or assist with any associated costs you may incur. Depending on the circumstances, your travel insurance may offer cover for curtailment and we suggest </span></p>
<p style="text-align: left;"><span style="color: #000000;">that any claim is made directly with them.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: left;"><span style="color: #000000;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p style="text-align: left;"><span style="color: #000000;"><strong>4.17. PASSPORTS</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align: left;"><span style="color: #000000;">If you wish to travel abroad you must hold a ten-year passport, even for a day trip. Ensure your passport is valid for the duration of your trip. Some countries have an immigration requirement for a passport to remain valid for a minimum period (usually six months) beyond date of entry to the country. This is a requirement of the country concerned. Any questions should be addressed to the relevant consulate or embassy. Foreign Nationals and all non-UK passport holders must check with the appropriate consulate or embassy before travel.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: left;"><span style="color: #000000;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p style="text-align: left;"><span style="color: #000000;"><strong>4.18. VISAS</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align: left;"><span style="color: #000000;">You may require a visa to enter the country you are travelling to. For all visa enquires contact the consulate or embassy of the country you plan to visit. You will be responsible for checking and confirming any Visa requirements. </span></p>
<p style="text-align: left;"><span style="color: #000000;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p style="text-align: left;"><span style="color: #000000;"><strong>4.19. MEDICAL ADVICE</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align: left;"><span style="color: #000000;">Some countries impose health restrictions and require vaccination certificates. These can vary from time to time and country to country (e.g. BSE &amp;Bird Flu or Yellow Fever &amp;Malaria). Under certain circumstances you may not be allowed to travel if you fail to meet certain requirements. It is your responsibility to ensure that you and your party are aware of, and abide by, all restrictions. You should check with the appropriate consulate or embassy before travel. Parachute is not qualified to give specific personal medical advice regarding vaccinations, inoculations or any other form of treatment you may need. We strongly suggest that you consult your doctor or qualified medical professional before travel. </span></p>
<p style="text-align: left;"><span style="color: #000000;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p style="text-align: left;"><span style="color: #000000;"><strong>4.20. DATA PROTECTION POLICY</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align: left;"><span style="color: #000000;">Information about you and members of your party, including your names, contact details and any special needs, disabilities or dietary requirements is collected by us when you request information or make a booking with us. You are responsible for ensuring that other members of your party are aware of our booking conditions and this privacy policy and that they consent to your acting on their behalf in your dealings with us. We may disclose this information to our service providers (who may be located outside the EEA) for the purpose of providing you with your travel arrangements and insurance. Only information necessary for this purpose will be disclosed to them. In the case of air travel, it may be mandatory for us to disclose information for security and anti-terrorism purposes and any other purpose imposed on us by governments or airlines. We may use your information for the purposes set out in our data protection registration with the Office of the Information Commissioner. Some information, for example relating to your religion or health, may be &ldquo;sensitive personal data&rdquo; within the meaning of the Data Protection Act 2018. We need this information to cater for your needs, but it is collected on condition that we have your positive consent. If you do not agree to our use of your information, we cannot accept your booking. By making a booking with us, you agree to allow your insurers, their agents and medical staff to disclose relevant information to us in circumstances where we may need to act in the interests of everyone in the group with whom you are travelling. For example, if you contract an infectious illness whilst on holiday, we may need to make special arrangements for you and ensure that you do not return with the group immediately. From time to time we may contact you by post with information about special offers or holidays. If you do not wish to receive such information, please notify us. You have the right to ask us in writing for a data subject access request form to obtain a copy of the information that we hold about you. You will be charged a fee for this. Any request should be addressed to The Company Secretary, Graduate Memorial Building, Trinity College Dublin, College Green, Dublin 2. </span></p>
